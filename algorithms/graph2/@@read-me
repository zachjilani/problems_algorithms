HW 7 INSTRUCTION:

Copy all the HW6 files plus the stack class files.
cp  ../forHW6/*.h .
cp  ../forHW6/*.cpp .
cp  ../forHW1/HW1P1_stack/stack.*  .

1) The stack elements should be char this time.
2) Remove all couts from
   llist constructors and destructors. Remove other
   debegging couts.
3) Must add two functions to dgraph.h and dgraph.cpp

- void visit(int, char)
   which will enter the given visit number
   for a given vertex.
   This is to indicate the order in which
   vertices were visited.
 Do not use a loop to look for the vertex.
 Convert A to slot 0, B to slot 1 etc.

- bool isMarked(char)
  which returns true if a given vertex was
  already visited
  (0 means not visited so return false)
 Do not use a loop to look for a vertex

 -- Make sure displayGraph now displays
    the visit numbers as well. Make the graph look nice.

--------- Now to complete HW 7 -------------

** Read the assignment sheet thoroughly.

** First, check  my hw7.out. **

Create hw7client.cpp that performs DFS of a dgraph
producing the same output as mine.
Make sure you have added nice comments.
