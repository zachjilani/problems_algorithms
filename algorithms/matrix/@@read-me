Input file
lines.txt
------------

Specifies the content of your table.

each line has
row col followed by characters to go into that entry in the table

row is an integer  0, 1...
col is a character a, b...

The number of characters per entry is always the same. That is why I do not have ; at the end of each line. 

The matrix content should go to the output file at the end.

Run mat.out to see what your output should look like.

Feel free to change lines.txt to try different R, C and VM in mat.cpp
